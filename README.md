# Eskalate-Internship-Documentation
Welcome to Eskalate's Internship Program Documentation Repository! This repository provides a comprehensive set of materials, including learning path resources, evaluation forms, tracking sheets, and other resources to guide our software development interns.

Internship coordinators can use this repository to find every activity and material they need to operate throughout the internship season. Our documentation ensures a high-quality experience for interns and serves as a general template for future internship seasons, providing the necessary structure and guidance to help interns succeed.

Thank you for being part of Eskalate's Internship Program, and we hope you find these resources helpful as you navigate your software development internship!
